# Dental Driller
This code is a basic product for a dental driller equipment designed as a task for a medical equipment subject. The code utilizes a color sensor to detect different colors, providing a signal to control a component, presumably for safety or operational purposes.

## Description

The code defines pins for a color sensor and sets up the necessary configurations to read pulse widths corresponding to red, green, and blue colors. It then adjusts the behavior of a designated pin (`a`) based on the detected color.

## Components

- Color sensor
- Arduino or compatible microcontroller
- LED or any other output component connected to pin `a`

## Setup

1. Connect the color sensor to the appropriate pins on the Arduino:
   - `S0` to pin 4
   - `S1` to pin 5
   - `S2` to pin 6
   - `S3` to pin 7
   - `sensorOut` to pin 8

2. Connect the output component (e.g., LED) to pin `a`.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor to observe the detected colors and corresponding pulse widths.
3. Based on the detected color, the code will adjust the output on pin `a`. Ensure the connected component responds accordingly.

## Note
- This is a basic implementation. For educational medical purposes only.
